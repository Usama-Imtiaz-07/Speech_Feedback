This project combines Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Sentiment Analysis, and Speech Feedback to create a system that transcribes spoken language, analyzes sentiment, and provides actionable feedback based on the transcription and sentiment.

### Project Overview
ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition): Uses the Whisper model to transcribe speech to text, with a focus on Hindi language transcription.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of the transcribed text to determine the emotional tone (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
Speech Feedback: Provides feedback based on the sentiment and transcription, offering suggestions for improvement or emotional insights.
### Key Components
Whisper Model: A state-of-the-art ASR model from OpenAI, fine-tuned for Hindi language transcription.
Sentiment Analysis Model: A model that analyzes the sentiment of the transcribed text, helping understand the emotional context.
Speech Feedback System: Based on the transcription and sentiment, the system generates feedback, such as encouragement for positive sentiment or suggestions for improvement for negative sentiment.
### Features
Real-time transcription of spoken language into text.
Sentiment analysis to assess the emotional tone of the speech.
Feedback generation based on sentiment and content to guide improvement.
Integrated with Weights & Biases (WandB) for experiment tracking and visualization of metrics.
Supports training on Amazon SageMaker for large-scale data processing and model training.
### How It Works
Speech Input: The user provides speech input (audio file or real-time recording).
Transcription (ASR): The Whisper model transcribes the audio into text.
Sentiment Analysis: The transcribed text is analyzed to detect the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
Speech Feedback: Based on the sentiment and content, the system generates feedback to guide the user (e.g., improve tone, encourage positive speech).
Training and Monitoring: The training process is managed using AWS SageMaker, and performance metrics are tracked through Weights & Biases.
### Technologies Used
Whisper (OpenAI): For speech-to-text transcription.
Sentiment Analysis: Custom model or pre-trained sentiment models (e.g., BERT-based).
AWS SageMaker: For large-scale training and model deployment.
Weights & Biases (WandB): For experiment tracking and model performance visualization.
### Use Cases
Personal Improvement: Helps users improve their speech delivery and emotional tone.
Customer Service: Analyzes customer sentiment during calls and provides feedback.
Language Learning: Assists learners by transcribing their speech and providing emotional feedback.
